> Originally built for bitporn.eu
>
> This tool was originally built for **bitporn.eu**, but it can be customised for any site, tracker, upload workflow, or personal media archive.
>
> Version 5.1 includes the refreshed dark/lime Pumpkin UI, a cleaner thumbnail queue, a better progress footer, compact logo sizing controls, a Skip Existing toggle, and session-only logo changes.

> Version 5.2 adds an optional **Footer** toggle, an **Animation** choice of WebP or AVIF (GUI dropdown, CLI `--format`), an encoder method that follows the speed profile, a quality search that fits each animation under the size cap at the highest quality, reproducible still-frame choices, a non-blocking logo loader, a more responsive Stop button, and automated tests for the Linux CLI. The CLI header is now 146 px, matching the GUI, so default CLI sheets are 960 px tall instead of 970.

# Version Notes

**Linux users:** the **5.2 CLI edition** runs in a terminal or over SSH. Start with the [Linux installation and commands](linux/README.md). The CLI needs Python **3.10+**, Pillow, FFmpeg and a system font; it does not need a desktop, Tkinter, OpenCV or NumPy. The Windows GUI is the single script `Pumpkin’s Thumb It 5.2.py`.

The older v5 script (original orange theme) has been removed from the repository; it remains available in the Git history.

Pumpkin's Thumb It 5.2 is the updated version with the new layout, refreshed controls, and dark/lime Pumpkin theme.

Generated images no longer include the former orange promotional footer bar (an optional footer is available, see below).

---

# Overview

Pumpkin's Thumb It 5.2 creates thumbnail packs, animated previews, and screenshots from video files and folders. It is available as a Windows GUI and a Linux CLI.

It is designed for torrent upload preparation, media previews, and fast thumbnail generation for large video folders.

The app can generate:

- PNG thumbnail sheets
- Animated WEBP thumbnail sheets
- Center preview animations
- Longest-video preview animations
- Single preview screenshots
- Automatic `/scr` output folders
- Logo-branded thumbnail headers
- No promotional footer or extra footer height
- Media-info headers with video/audio details
- ETA and elapsed-time tracking
- Skip Existing output handling

---

# Main Features

## Thumbnail Sheet Generation

For every video, the app creates a full thumbnail sheet using extracted frames from across the video.

Each sheet includes:

- File name
- File size
- Resolution
- FPS
- Duration
- Video codec
- Video bitrate
- Audio codec
- Audio bitrate
- Audio channels
- Optional logo in the top-right corner

Output example:

```text
VIDEO_FOLDER/scr/sheet_VideoName.png
```

## PNG Output

Thumbnail sheets are saved as PNG files.

```text
sheet_VideoName.png
```

PNG compression is controlled inside the script with:

```python
PNG_COMPRESS_LEVEL = 6
```

## Animated WEBP Sheets

The app creates animated WEBP thumbnail sheets for the first videos in each folder.

By default, the first 5 videos in a folder can create:

```text
center1.webp
center2.webp
center3.webp
center4.webp
center5.webp
```

Each animated WEBP uses multiple animated thumbnail slots from different parts of the video.

## Center Longest Preview

For each folder, the app finds the longest video and creates a center animation from it.

Output example:

```text
centerlongest_FolderName.webp
```

This is useful for packs where the longest video should act as the main animated preview.

## Single Screen Output

The app also creates a single screenshot from the longest video in the folder.

Output:

```text
screen.png
```

## Automatic SCR Folder

All generated files are placed inside a `scr` folder beside the videos.

Example:

```text
VIDEO_FOLDER/
|-- video1.mp4
|-- video2.mkv
`-- scr/
    |-- sheet_video1.png
    |-- sheet_video2.png
    |-- center1.webp
    |-- center2.webp
    |-- center3.webp
    |-- center4.webp
    |-- center5.webp
    |-- centerlongest_FOLDER.webp
    `-- screen.png
```

## Clean Output Without a Promotional Footer

The orange `MADE WITH PUMPKIN'S THUMB IT AVAILABLE ON GITHUB FREE` bar has been removed from all generated outputs.

This applies to:

- PNG thumbnail sheets
- Animated WEBP thumbnail sheets
- Center and longest-video previews
- Single preview screenshots

By default no footer height is reserved, so generated images end at the normal content boundary. The 5.2 GUI has an optional **Footer** toggle in Sheet Settings: turn it ON and enter your own text to add an orange bar with that text under each sheet and animation (session only, OFF by default; unavailable while a job is running). Existing files are not modified automatically; regenerate them with **Skip Existing: OFF** to remove the footer from older outputs.

---

# Pumpkin Night UI Theme

Version 5.2 uses a dark Pumpkin Night style theme with lime action accents.

Main colours:

```text
Background: #0b1118
Panel:      #16212c
Field:      #09121c
Accent:     #b8e600
Highlight:  #d5ff1f
Text:       #f2f6fb
Muted Text: #b6c0cb
Border:     #36414f
```

The UI includes:

---

# Logo Settings

The logo can be changed directly from the app UI.

Supported logo sources:

```text
https://example.com/logo.png
C:\Users\YourName\Pictures\logo.png
```

Supported local logo formats:

```text
.png
.jpg
.jpeg
.webp
```

The UI includes:

```text
Sheet Logo: [logo URL/path]
W: [width] H: [height]
[Apply Logo] [Preview] [Browse]
```

Recommended max logo size:

```text
420 x 120
```

Click **Preview** to open a mock thumbnail sheet header.

The preview shows:

- Example media info text
- The selected logo
- The current logo size
- The calculated header height

Click **Apply Logo** to use the current logo. The logo field starts blank, and the app remembers the last logo file or URL you applied and the last folder you browsed, so the next launch starts with that logo and **Browse** opens in that folder. Apply a blank logo to forget it. The logo width and height are for the open session only.

These two values are stored in `settings.json` under `%APPDATA%/Pumpkin's Thumb It/` (or `~/.config/Pumpkin's Thumb It/` when `APPDATA` is not set). Delete that file to reset them.

---

# Auto-Resizing Header

The generated thumbnail sheet header automatically adjusts to fit the logo height.

This prevents the top-right logo from being clipped if a taller logo is used.

---

# Skip Existing Outputs

The app includes a **Skip Existing** toggle button.

When enabled:

```text
Skip Existing: ON
```

The app checks whether expected output files already exist before regenerating them.

It checks for:

```text
sheet_VideoName.png
center1.webp
center2.webp
center3.webp
center4.webp
center5.webp
centerlongest_FolderName.webp
screen.png
```

Use **ON** when you are adding new videos to a folder that already has generated sheets or previews.

When disabled:

```text
Skip Existing: OFF
```

The app rebuilds outputs even if they already exist.

Use **OFF** when you changed the logo, changed settings, or want to regenerate everything fresh.

---

# ETA / Progress Tracking

The app shows live processing information.

Example:

```text
Elapsed: 00:04:12
ETA: 00:08:30
Avg: 25s/file
```

The ETA becomes more accurate as more files complete.

---

# Quality Modes

The **Quality** dropdown trades output quality against processing time. The CLI exposes the same profiles as `--speed normal|fast|fastest`.

| Quality | Description | WebP encoder method | AVIF encoder speed |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| High (slowest) | Best compression and visual quality | 6 | 4 |
| Medium (balanced) | Balanced speed and quality (default) | 3 | 6 |
| Low (fastest) | Quickest processing | 1 | 8 |

The profile also sets the starting WebP quality (85, 75 and 70) and the number of videos processed in parallel. Proxy-safe mode no longer caps WebP quality, so High, Medium and Low start at 85, 75 and 70. Each animation is then searched for the highest quality that fits under the size limit (see **WEBP Output Is Too Large**).

---

# Performance Features

The app includes several performance-focused features:

- Multi-threaded processing
- CPU usage limiting
- Optional CPU affinity control using `psutil`
- OpenCV optimisations
- FFmpeg fallback extraction
- WMV fallback handling
- Proxy-safe WEBP settings (960 x 540 longest-video clip)
- WEBP and AVIF file size limiting
- Quality search that keeps the highest quality that fits under the size limit
- Faster animated WEBP clip extraction
- Shadow-free thumbnail rendering for extra speed

---

# Supported Video Formats

```text
.mp4
.m4v
.mkv
.mov
.avi
.wmv
```

---

# System Requirements

These requirements and the following GUI instructions apply to the **Windows application**. See [Linux CLI installation and commands](linux/README.md) for the terminal edition.

- Windows OS
- Python 3.9+
- FFmpeg
- FFprobe
- Required Python libraries

---

# Python Dependencies

Install dependencies with:

```bash
pip install opencv-python pillow numpy requests tkinterdnd2 psutil
```

`psutil` is recommended for CPU limiting, but the app can still run without it.

---

# FFmpeg Setup

The app checks these default FFmpeg and FFprobe paths first:

```text
C:\ffmpeg\bin\ffmpeg.exe
C:\ffmpeg\bin\ffprobe.exe
```

Inside the script:

```python
FFPROBE = r"C:\ffmpeg\bin\ffprobe.exe"
FFMPEG  = r"C:\ffmpeg\bin\ffmpeg.exe"
```

If FFmpeg is installed somewhere else, update those values or add FFmpeg to your system PATH.

---

# Installation Guide

## 1. Download Project

Either clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/PumpkinPounder/Pumpkin-Thumb-It.git
cd Pumpkin-Thumb-It
```

Or download the ZIP file and extract it.

## 2. Install Python Dependencies

Open Command Prompt inside the project folder and run:

```bash
pip install opencv-python pillow numpy requests tkinterdnd2 psutil
```

## 3. Install FFmpeg

This program checks for FFmpeg in:

```text
C:\ffmpeg\bin\
```

You should have:

```text
C:\ffmpeg\bin\ffmpeg.exe
C:\ffmpeg\bin\ffprobe.exe
```

If not:

1. Download a Windows FFmpeg build.
2. Extract it.
3. Move the folder to `C:\ffmpeg\`.
4. Confirm `ffmpeg.exe` and `ffprobe.exe` are inside `C:\ffmpeg\bin\`.

You can also add FFmpeg to your system PATH.

---

# How To Run

From the project folder:

```bash
python "Pumpkin’s Thumb It 5.2.py"
```

Or double-click the `.py` file.

If your script has a different filename, run that file instead.

---

# How To Use

1. Open the app.
2. Add videos using **Add Videos**, **Add Video Folder**, or drag and drop.
3. Select quality: **High** (slowest), **Medium** (balanced) or **Low** (fastest). Optionally set **Animation** to **AVIF** for `.avif` animated outputs instead of WebP (needs Pillow 11.3+ with AVIF support; confirm your destination accepts animated AVIF).
4. Optional: change the logo, preview the logo, or browse for a local logo.
5. Choose whether **Skip Existing** should be ON or OFF.
6. Click **Generate Thumbnails**.
7. Generated files will appear in the video's `scr` folder.

---

# Output Files

For each video:

```text
sheet_VideoName.png
```

For the first animated videos in a folder:

```text
center1.webp
center2.webp
center3.webp
center4.webp
center5.webp
```

For the longest video in a folder:

```text
centerlongest_FolderName.webp
screen.png
```

With **Animation: AVIF** selected, the `center*` and `centerlongest_*` files are `.avif` instead of `.webp`. PNG sheets and `screen.png` do not change.

---

# Stop Processing

Click **Stop After Current Task** to safely stop processing.

The app finishes current running tasks where possible, then stops the remaining queue.

---

# Log Tools

The log box shows:

- Loaded files
- Processing start
- Current folder
- Finished files
- Skipped existing files
- Saved outputs
- Errors
- Completion message

Buttons:

```text
Copy Log
Clear Log
```

---

# Main Config Options

These can be edited inside the script if needed.

```python
FFPROBE = r"C:\ffmpeg\bin\ffprobe.exe"
FFMPEG  = r"C:\ffmpeg\bin\ffmpeg.exe"

SUPPORTED_EXTENSIONS = (".mp4", ".m4v", ".mkv", ".mov", ".avi", ".wmv")

LOGO_URL = ""
LOGO_MAX_W_PX = 420
LOGO_MAX_H_PX = 120

SKIP_EXISTING_OUTPUTS = True

ANIMATED_SHEETS_PER_FOLDER = 5
ANIM_NAME_PREFIX = "center"

ANIM_SECONDS = 6.0
ANIM_FPS = 12

CENTERLONGEST_SECONDS = 6.0
CENTERLONGEST_FPS = 12

MAX_WEBP_BYTES = 5 * 1024 * 1024
MIN_WEBP_QUALITY = 25

AVIF_START_QUALITY = 90
AVIF_MIN_QUALITY = 20

FOOTER_BAR_HEIGHT = 34

PNG_COMPRESS_LEVEL = 6
```

`ANIM_FORMAT`, `FOOTER_HEIGHT` and `FOOTER_TEXT` are set from the **Animation** dropdown and **Footer** toggle each time you press **Generate Thumbnails**, so editing them in the script has no effect.

---

# Notes

- The app creates a `/scr` folder automatically.
- Existing outputs can be skipped using the Skip Existing toggle.
- WMV files use FFmpeg extraction to avoid missing-frame issues.
- Local logos and remote logo URLs are both supported.
- The last applied logo and the last logo folder are remembered between launches; logo size changes apply to the current session.
- The thumbnail sheet header grows automatically if the selected logo is taller than the default header.
- All outputs are designed to be useful for torrent upload descriptions, gallery previews, and media packs.

---

# Troubleshooting

## FFmpeg Missing

If the app says FFmpeg is missing, check that these files exist:

```text
C:\ffmpeg\bin\ffmpeg.exe
C:\ffmpeg\bin\ffprobe.exe
```

If they are installed somewhere else, update these lines inside the script:

```python
FFPROBE = r"C:\ffmpeg\bin\ffprobe.exe"
FFMPEG  = r"C:\ffmpeg\bin\ffmpeg.exe"
```

Or add FFmpeg to your system PATH.

## Logo Does Not Load

Check that:

- The URL is reachable.
- The local file path exists.
- The file is a supported image type.
- The width and height values are valid numbers.

## WEBP Output Is Too Large

The app searches for the highest quality (down to a floor of 25 for WebP, 20 for AVIF) whose output fits under the configured limit:

```python
MAX_WEBP_BYTES = 5 * 1024 * 1024
```

You can increase that value if your site allows larger files. If even the floor quality is over the limit, the GUI keeps the floor-quality file; lower `ANIM_SECONDS` or `ANIM_FPS` to shrink it.

## App Feels Slow

Try:

- Using **Low (fastest)** quality.
- Reducing the number of files processed at once.
- Lowering animated WEBP duration or FPS.
- Closing other heavy programs while processing.

# Linux CLI

The Linux edition is included directly in the repository's `main` branch under [`linux/`](linux/). There is no separate Linux download or extra branch to find. The folder contains only the files a user needs: the CLI, installation metadata and its user README.

```text
linux/
├── README.md
├── pyproject.toml
├── thumb_it/
└── tests/        (developer tests; not installed with the package)
```

Open the [`linux` folder](linux/) and follow its **[installation instructions and full command reference](linux/README.md)**.

After installing the CLI using the Linux README:

```bash
thumb-it doctor
thumb-it "/media/videos" --recursive
thumb-it --help
```

The CLI needs Python **3.10+**, Pillow, FFmpeg/FFprobe and a system font. It runs without a desktop or the Windows GUI dependencies. The repository workflow checks that the Linux package builds and installs on Ubuntu and Debian; users do not need the developer test files.
